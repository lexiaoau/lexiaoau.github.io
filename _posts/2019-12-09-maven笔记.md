## Build the Project

### Phase

### Build Lifecycle 

>         * validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
>         * compile - compile the source code of the project
>         * test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
>         * package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
>         * verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
>         * install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
>         * deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
